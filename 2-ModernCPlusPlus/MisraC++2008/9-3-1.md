The rule depicted in the image, "Rule 9-3-1 (Required): const member functions shall not return non-const pointers or references to class-data," is a guideline from the MISRA C++ coding standard, which aims to ensure safety, security, and reliability in critical systems, such as automotive software.

### Explanation of the Rule:

**const Member Function:**

- A member function in C++ can be declared as `const`, which means it cannot modify any member variables of the class (except those marked as `mutable`).

**Non-const Pointer/Reference:**

- A non-const pointer or reference allows modification of the pointed-to or referred-to object.

**Class-data:**

- Data members (variables) of the class.

### Rule Summary:

A `const` member function should not return a non-const pointer or reference to class data. Instead, it should return a `const` pointer or reference if access to class data is needed.

### Example of Non-compliant Code:

```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int data;

public:
    int* getData() const {
        return &data;  // Returning a non-const pointer from a const member function
    }
};
```
In this example, `getData()` is a `const` member function, but it returns a non-const pointer to `data`. This violates Rule 9-3-1.

### Compliant Code:
```cpp
class MyClass {
private:
    int data;

public:
    const int* getData() const {
        return &data;  // Returning a const pointer from a const member function
    }
};
```
Here, `getData()` returns a `const` pointer to `data`, complying with Rule 9-3-1.

### Why the Rule is Important:

1. **Preservation of Const Correctness:**
    - `const` member functions are meant to guarantee that they do not modify the objectâ€™s state. Allowing a `const` member function to return a non-const pointer or reference breaks this guarantee indirectly, as it allows modification through the returned pointer or reference.
2. **Data Integrity and Safety:**
    - Returning a non-const pointer or reference from a `const` member function can lead to unintended modifications of class data. This can result in unpredictable behavior, bugs, or vulnerabilities, particularly in safety-critical systems.
3. **Code Clarity and Maintainability:**
    - Const correctness improves code clarity and maintainability by clearly specifying which functions can modify an object and which cannot. This distinction helps developers understand and predict the behavior of the code.
4. **Avoids Subtle Bugs:**
    - Violating const correctness can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to track down, as the guarantee provided by `const` is broken. Following this rule helps in maintaining robust and predictable code.

In summary, this rule ensures that `const` member functions maintain their contract of not modifying the class's state by preventing them from returning non-const pointers or references to class data.
