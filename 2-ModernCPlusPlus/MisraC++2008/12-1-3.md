### All constructors that are callable with a single argument of fundamental type shall be declared explicit. 


when a class has a constructor that takes a single argument, that constructor can be used to automatically convert an object of the argument type to an object of the class type. This behavior is known as "implicit conversion" and can sometimes lead to unexpected or unintended behavior.

For example, consider the following class:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(int value) {
        // Construct MyClass object from an integer
    }
};
```
In this case, the constructor `MyClass(int value)` can be used to implicitly convert an `int` to a `MyClass` object. This means that the following code would be valid:

```cpp
MyClass obj = 42; // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass
// MyClass obj = MyClass(42)    
```

This can lead to issues, especially when the constructor is being used in unexpected ways, such as in function calls or arithmetic operations. For example:

```cpp
void doSomething(MyClass obj) {
    // Do something with the MyClass object
}

doSomething(42); // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass
```
	
To prevent these types of unintended implicit conversions, the C++ standard recommends marking such constructors as `explicit`. When a constructor is marked as `explicit`, it can no longer be used for implicit conversions, and the code above would result in a compile-time error.
Here's the same `MyClass` example with the constructor marked as `explicit`:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    explicit MyClass(int value) {
        // Construct MyClass object from an integer
    }
};

MyClass obj = 42; // Error: cannot convert 'int' to 'MyClass'
doSomething(42); // Error: cannot convert 'int' to 'MyClass'
```

By using the `explicit` keyword, you make it clear that the constructor should only be used for explicit conversions, which helps to avoid unexpected behavior and makes the code more intentional and easier to understand.

In summary, the rule "All constructors that are callable with a single argument of fundamental type shall be declared `explicit`" is a best practice in C++ that helps prevent unintended implicit conversions and makes the code more robust and maintainable.
