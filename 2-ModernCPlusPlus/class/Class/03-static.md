Yes, in C++, there is a rule that requires the definition of static const integral data members outside the class if they are used in a way that requires a definition (such as taking their address). This rule is based on the C++ standard, which requires that static data members must be defined outside the class if they are to be used.

### Explanation:

1. **Static Member Variables:**
    
    - Static member variables are shared among all instances of a class.
    - They need to be defined outside the class definition, even though they are declared inside the class.
2. **Const Member Variables:**
    
    - Const member variables are constant and cannot be modified after their initialization.
3. **Integral Types:**
    
    - Integral types include types like `int`, `char`, `long`, etc.

### Declaration and Definition:

When you declare a static const integral member inside the class, you must provide its definition outside the class if it is odr-used (e.g., its address is taken).

### Example:

#### Inside the Class (Declaration):

```cpp
`class MyClass { public:     static const int value = 42; 
// Declaration and initialization inside the class };`
```
#### Outside the Class (Definition):
```cpp
`const int MyClass::value; 
// Definition outside the class (needed if value is odr-used)`
```
### Why the Definition is Needed:

The definition outside the class is necessary to allocate storage for the static member. Without this definition, the compiler will not allocate memory for the static member, leading to linker errors if the member is used in a way that requires its address (such as passing it to a function that takes a pointer or reference).

### Example of Usage:

#### inside the class:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    static const int value = 42; // Declaration
};

int main() {
    std::cout << MyClass::value << std::endl; // This will work without the definition
    return 0;
}

```

#### outside the class:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    static const int value; // Declaration
};

// Definition
const int MyClass::value{42};

void printValue(const int* p) {
    std::cout << *p << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printValue(&MyClass::value); // This requires the definition outside the class
    return 0;
}

```

### Summary:

- **Static Const Integral Members**: Can be initialized inside the class but must be defined outside the class if they are used in ways that require their definition (like taking their address).
- **Non-integral Static Const Members**: Always need an out-of-class definition, but the initialization must be done in the definition outside the class.

This requirement ensures that the C++ compiler and linker correctly allocate storage and manage the linkage for static members, maintaining consistent behavior across different translation units.


```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
public:
    static const int value = 42; // Declaration and initialization
};

void fun(const int &b)
{
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
}
int main()
{
    fun(MyClass::value);
    return 0;
}
```
this will produce a linking error
```bash
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccFaFZnb.o: warning: relocation against `_ZN7MyClass5valueE' in read-only section `.text'
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccFaFZnb.o: in function `main':
05-static.cpp:(.text+0x47): undefined reference to `MyClass::value'
/usr/bin/ld: warning: creating DT_TEXTREL in a PIE
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
public:
    static const int value; // Declaration in-class 
};

// Provide an out-of-class definition
const int MyClass::value = 42;

void fun(const int &b)
{
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
}
int main()
{
    fun(MyClass::value);
    return 0;
}

```
